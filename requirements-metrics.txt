# Metrics-only environment requirements
# Install in a dedicated env (recommended):
#   conda create -n metrics python=3.10 -y
#   conda activate metrics
#   cd C:\Codebase\VD\VideoDubbing
#   pip install -r requirements-metrics.txt
#
# Notes:
# - This env is intended to run evaluation metrics only.
# - Speaker similarity uses SpeechBrain ECAPA embeddings (free model download).
# - Prosody metrics use ffmpeg + numpy (no paid API).
